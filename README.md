Unity 2D game top to bottom, your objective is to get the prizes beneath each divine tree, but there's a catch.
To get to each prize chest you must mine your way to it, but what will you do with all the dirt and stone you mined out?
Ah well it sure is nice to have a trash portal simply laying around near you doesn't it?
